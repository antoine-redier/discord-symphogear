## Using:

You need to have PostgreSQL installed and running to run the tests correctly.

You will need to provide these environment variables to make the bot run:

-   For the PostgreSQL database:
    -   DBHOST: The adress of your PostgreSQL instance
    -   DBUSER: The user
    -   DBNAME: The name of the database
    -   DBPASSWORD: The password for the user
    -   DBPORT: The port on which PostgreSQL runs
-   For the bot itself:
    -   BOT_TOKEN: The bot token

## Contributing:

See the open issues if you want to contribute. Feel free to add some if you feel the bot is lacking in functionality you might want.

Be aware that there are git hooks for formatting and linting.
